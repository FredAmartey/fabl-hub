# Fabl MVP: Granular Task Breakdown

This document provides an incredibly granular, step-by-step plan to build the Fabl MVP. Each task is designed to be:

- **Small & Testable**: Can be completed and verified in isolation
- **Clear Scope**: Has explicit start/end conditions
- **Single Concern**: Focuses on one specific functionality

## ðŸ“‹ Project Context

This task breakdown is designed for an **existing Vite + React + TailwindCSS frontend** with substantial UI components already built. Instead of creating a new monorepo structure, we'll:

- **Add a `/api` backend folder** to the existing project structure
- **Enhance existing UI components** (Header, Sidebar, VideoCard, VideoGrid, etc.) with real data
- **Connect existing page components** (HomePage, UploadPage, VideoPage, etc.) to the backend
- **Leverage existing styling** and component architecture

**Existing Components to Enhance:**

- âœ… Header, Sidebar, Button, VideoCard, VideoGrid
- âœ… HomePage, VideoPage, UploadPage, ProfilePage, and 6 other page components
- âœ… TailwindCSS configuration and styling
- âœ… Vite build system

## Testing Strategy for Each Task

For every task, verify completion using these methods:

1. **Unit Tests**: Where applicable, write tests that verify the specific functionality
2. **Manual Testing**: Use curl, Postman, or browser to verify endpoints work
3. **Integration Testing**: Ensure the feature works with existing components
4. **Error Case Testing**: Verify proper handling of invalid inputs/edge cases

## Success Criteria

The MVP is complete when:

- Users can sign up, create channels, and upload videos
- Videos are automatically moderated for content and AI ratio
- Basic social features (likes, comments, subscriptions) work
- Trending and recommendation systems provide relevant content
- The application is production-ready with proper error handling and monitoring

Each task should be completed in isolation and thoroughly tested before moving to the next task.
