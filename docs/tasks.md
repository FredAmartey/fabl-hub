# Fabl MVP: Granular Task Breakdown

This document provides an incredibly granular, step-by-step plan to build the Fabl MVP. Each task is designed to be:

- **Small & Testable**: Can be completed and verified in isolation
- **Clear Scope**: Has explicit start/end conditions
- **Single Concern**: Focuses on one specific functionality

## ðŸ“‹ Project Context

Fabl is now architected as a **monorepo with two separate Next.js applications**:

- **Hub App** (`/apps/hub`): The main video platform for viewers (runs on port 3000)
- **Studio App** (`/apps/studio`): Creator dashboard for content management (runs on port 3001)

This architecture provides complete separation of concerns between viewing and content creation.

**Current Status:**

- âœ… Monorepo structure established
- âœ… Two separate Next.js applications created
- âœ… Cross-app navigation implemented (Upload button â†’ Studio)
- âœ… Environment-based URL configuration
- âœ… TailwindCSS and component structure in place

**Key Architectural Decisions:**

- Complete application separation (no shared routing)
- Single Sign-On (SSO) between applications
- Environment variables for cross-app URLs
- Seamless upload flow (Hub â†’ Studio)

2. **Manual Testing**: Use curl, Postman, or browser to verify endpoints work
3. **Integration Testing**: Ensure the feature works with existing components
4. **Error Case Testing**: Verify proper handling of invalid inputs/edge cases

## Success Criteria

The MVP is complete when:

- Users can sign up on either Hub or Studio with SSO between apps
- Authenticated users see Upload button, unauthenticated see Sign In
- Upload button seamlessly redirects authenticated users to Studio
- Users can create channels and upload videos in Studio
- Videos uploaded in Studio appear in Hub for viewing
- Videos are automatically moderated for content and AI ratio
- Basic social features (likes, comments, subscriptions) work
- Trending and recommendation systems provide relevant content
- Both applications are production-ready with proper error handling

Each task should be completed in isolation and thoroughly tested before moving to the next task.
